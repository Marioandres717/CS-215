ONLY FOUR NEW FILES FROM LAST ASSIGNMENT(4), ALL OTHER FILES STAYED THE SAME. 
EXCEPT FOR index.php A WAS ADDED BUTTON ADDED FOR CONTROLLING UPDATES

updateComments.php = handles the ajax request for new comments
updateMessages.php =  handles the ajax request for new Messages
passgen.php = handles ajax request for 5 passcodes that are not used already
public/js/checkUpdates.js = Event registration for messageList page (index.php)

IMPORTANT!
ALL MY AJAX JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS FOR MAKING THE AJAX REQUEST AND HANDLING IT ARE IN functionality.js
THERE IS 5 NEW FUNCTIONS, ALL OF THEM ARE DEFINED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE

THE NEW FUNCTIONS ARE:

addString -> adds the suggested passcode to the input field
suggestPasscode -> ajax request for 5 unused passcodes
commentUpdates -> request and handles new comments
Updates -> request and handles new comments
enableUpdates -> control updates button implementation
